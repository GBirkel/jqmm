Jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/) provide computable appendices that interactively demonstrate the funcionality of the jQMM library.
We provide them in two forms: (1) .ipynb files that represent the actual computable notebook and (2) .html files that provide a quick well formated version (can be seen properly formatted in any browswer using 'Open File..')
