Jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/) provide computable appendices that interactively demonstrate the funcionality of the jQMM library.

We provide them in two forms: (1) .ipynb files that represent the actual computable notebook and (2) .html files that provide a quick look at the results. 

In order to view the .html files properly, download them and then open them with any modern browswer (e.g. use "Open File.." in chrome).
