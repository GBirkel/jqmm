# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/) provide computable appendices that interactively demonstrate the funcionality of the jQMM library.

We provide them in two forms: (1) .ipynb files that represent the actual computable notebook and (2) .html files that provide a quick look at the results. 

In order to view the .html files properly, download them and then open them with any modern browswer (e.g. use "Open File.." in chrome). Alternatively, you can view the .html by preappending http://htmlpreview.github.io/? to any file. For example:
