# JBEI Quantitative Metabolic Modeling Library

The jQMM library is an open-source, python-based framework for modeling internal metabolic fluxes and leveraging other 'omics data for bioengineering.  It is intended to facilitate the design and metabolic engineering of organisms for biofuels and other chemicals, as well as investigations of cellular metabolism and â€™omics data leveraging.  As an open source software project, JBEI hopes it will attract additions from the community and grow with the rapidly changing field of metabolic flux analysis.

* The jQMM is a complete toolbox for performing types of flux analysis that are typically disjoint: Flux Balance Analysis and 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis.
* The jQMM can use 13C labeling experimental data to constrain comprehensive genome-scale models through a technique called two-scale 13C Metabolic Flux Analysis (2S-13C MFA).
* The jQMM includes a demonstration of a method that uses proteomics data to produce actionable items that increase biofuel production.

All code is illustrated in a variety of Jupyter notebook demos that enhance reproducibility and provide the capability to be modified by the user.
